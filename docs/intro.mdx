## What is Hyperlane?[​](#what-is-hyperlane "Direct link to What is Hyperlane?")

Hyperlane is a permissionless interoperability protocol for cross-chain communication across different blockchain environments. It enables message passing and asset transfers across different chains without relying on centralized intermediaries or requiring any permissions.

### Key Features[​](#key-features "Direct link to Key Features")

- **Permissionless**: Anyone can [deploy Hyperlane](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/guides/chains/deploy-hyperlane), whether it is a layer 1, rollup, or app-chain, and start building cross-chain applications right away—no approvals, no intermediaries.
- **Modular Security**: Hyperlane's [Interchain Security Modules (ISM)](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/protocol/ISM/modular-security) allow developers to configure, compose, and customize their security model according to their application's needs.
- **Multi-VM Support**: Hyperlane enables cross-chain communication for multiple virtual machines (VMs), including EVM, SVM and CosmWasm.
  - Hyperlane also supports **cross-VM interactions**, such as EVM ↔ SVM asset transfers.

## Start Building with Hyperlane[​](#start-building-with-hyperlane "Direct link to Start Building with Hyperlane")

Get started with Hyperlane by exploring deployment guides & key features:

- **[Bridge any token with Hyperlane Warp Routes](/docs/guides/quickstart/deploy-warp-route)**: Warp Routes let you deploy a custom token bridge, enabling any native or `ERC20` token to be transferred across chains.

  - For **EVM-based chains**, use the **[EVM Warp Route Guide](/docs/guides/quickstart/deploy-warp-route)**.
  - For **Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) chains**, see the **[SVM Warp Route Guide](/docs/guides/warp-routes/svm/svm-warp-route-guide)**.
  - For **Cosmos SDK-based chains**, use the **[Cosmos SDK Module](docs/alt-vm-implementations/cosmos-sdk)**.
  - For **cross-chain transfers between EVM and SVM**, check out the **[EVM-SVM Warp Route Guide](/docs/guides/warp-routes/evm-svm-warp-route-guide)**.

- **[Learn about General Message Passing](/docs/reference/messaging/send)**: Send arbitrary messages between chains.

- **Use [Interchain Accounts](https://docs.hyperlane.xyzdocs/applications/interchain-account)**: Execute smart contract calls on remote chains from a single account.

- **[Deploy Hyperlane to your chain](/docs/guides/chains/deploy-hyperlane)**: Set up Hyperlane on a new chain.
