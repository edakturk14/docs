## General Troubleshooting[​](#general-troubleshooting "Direct link to General Troubleshooting")

### Logging[​](#logging "Direct link to Logging")

Logging levels and formats can be configured for Hyperlane tooling using the following two environment variables:

* `LOG_LEVEL`: The log level to filter to. Defaults to `info`. Choices: `debug | info | warn | error | off`
* `LOG_FORMAT`: The format of the log output. Defaults to `pretty`. Choices: `pretty | json`

The [Hyperlane CLI](/docs/reference/cli) also allows configuring logging via the `--log` and `--verbosity` flags.

### Chain Configuration[​](#chain-configuration "Direct link to Chain Configuration")

Within your working directory, you may find a `chains/` yaml files organized by chain name. These `metadata.yaml` files describe the information needed to use the chain in Hyperlane deployments and apps.

You can define a full configuration for any new chain in this file. The metadata that can be configured is defined in this [example configuration](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/typescript/cli/examples/chain-config.yaml). You can also find the chain metadata schema at [chainMetadataTypes.ts](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/typescript/sdk/src/metadata/chainMetadataTypes.ts).

Here's an example configuration for two local anvil chains:

<Accordion title="Example: Two Local Anvil Chains">
  ```
  anvil1:  chainId: 31337  domainId: 31337  name: anvil1  protocol: ethereum  rpcUrls:    - http: http://localhost:8545  nativeToken:    name: Ether    symbol: ETH    decimals: 18anvil2:  chainId: 31338  domainId: 31338  name: anvil2  protocol: ethereum  rpcUrls:    - http: http://localhost:8555
  ```
</Accordion>

You can also extend a core chain config by providing the fields to be overridden:

```
sepolia:  blocks:    confirmations: 2
```

#### Override RPC URLs[​](#override-rpc-urls "Direct link to Override RPC URLs")

You can override the RPC urls by extending the core chain config.

<Accordion title="Example: Define RPC URLs array and adjust retry settings">
  ```
  demochain:  name: demochain  chainId: 123456  domainId: 123456  protocol: ethereum  rpcUrls:    - http: https://rpc-testnet.demochain.ggsepolia:  rpcUrls:    - http: https://rpc2.sepolia.org    - http: https://some-other-sepolia-rpc.gg      retry:        maxRequests: 10
  ```
</Accordion>

#### Override transaction settings[​](#override-transaction-settings "Direct link to Override transaction settings")

Transaction overrides are any properties to include when forming transaction requests. For example:

* `gasPrice`: number | string
* `maxFeePerGas`: number | string
* `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: number | string
* `nonce`: number | string
* `type`: number
* `ccipReadEnabled`: boolean

In the example below we're using a gas price of 7 gwei, hardcoding the nonce, and setting a maximum value for the base and priority fees.

```
sepolia:  transactionOverrides:    gasPrice: 7000000000 # 7 gwei    maxFeePerGas: 150000000000 # 150 gwei    maxPriorityFeePerGas: 40000000000 # 40 gwei    nonce: 1337
```

<Warning>
  If you are overriding the nonce in the chain configuration, ensure you are updating the value on successful transactions.
</Warning>

### Message Delivery Issues[​](#message-delivery-issues "Direct link to Message Delivery Issues")

#### Long Message Delivery Times or Timeouts[​](#long-message-delivery-times-or-timeouts "Direct link to Long Message Delivery Times or Timeouts")

Delays or timeouts in message delivery often result from RPC issues, such as overloaded endpoints, or from chains that produce blocks only on demand.

To identify the issue, check for logs indicating RPC-related problems such as: `Deprioritizing an inner provider in FallbackProvider`

To address these delays:

* **Check RPC Health:** Ensure RPC endpoints are responsive.
* **Configure Chains with On-Demand Blocks:** For these chains, set the reorgPeriod to 0. This ensures that agents always look at the tip of the chain, avoiding delays caused by block finalization processes.

## Agent Troubleshooting[​](#agent-troubleshooting "Direct link to Agent Troubleshooting")

### Validator Troubleshooting[​](#validator-troubleshooting "Direct link to Validator Troubleshooting")

* **`Validator has not announced any storage locations` Warning:**

  * **Reason**: This occurs when the relayer cannot retrieve validator signatures required to process a message.

  * **Solution**:

    * Ensure the validators have announced their storage locations. Check validator logs for a message such as: `Validator has announced signature storage location, locations: ["file:///tmp/hyperlane-validator-signatures-local"]`
    * Verify that each validator has a unique signature storage path (`--checkpointSyncer.path`) to prevent overwriting.
    * Confirm that the relayer has read access to the storage paths.

* **`No ISM Found for Origin` Error**

  * **Reason**: This occurs when the Interchain Security Module (ISM) does not recognize the origin chain.

  * **Solution**:

    * Ensure the ISM configuration includes the Validators for the origin chain.
    * If it doesn't, add validators for the origin chain to your ISM.
    * Restart the relayer after updating the ISM configuration.

### Relayer Troubleshooting[​](#relayer-troubleshooting "Direct link to Relayer Troubleshooting")

#### Checking Pending Messages in the Queue[​](#checking-pending-messages-in-the-queue "Direct link to Checking Pending Messages in the Queue")

If messages are stuck in the relayer queue or not being processed, use the `list_operations` endpoint to inspect the relayer's queue:

```
curl http://0.0.0.0:9090/list_operations?destination_domain=<destination_domain_id>
```

This endpoint provides the status of messages in the queue and can help identify why they are not being delivered.

#### Debugging with Logs[​](#debugging-with-logs "Direct link to Debugging with Logs")

For detailed insights, enable debug logging and monitor the relayer's activity: `HYP_LOG_LEVEL=debug`. Once logs are captured, you can use them to locate issues with specific message IDs.

#### Retrying Messages[​](#retrying-messages "Direct link to Retrying Messages")

After reviewing the logs, you can trigger an immediate retry of all pending messages using the `message_retry` endpoint:

```
curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:9090/message_retry' \--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \--data '[{"messageid": "*", "origindomain": "*", "senderaddress": "*", "destinationdomain": "*", "recipientaddress": "*"}]'
```

Make sure that you use the most recent version of the relayer and capture all logs for debugging.

#### Relayer Selecting Incorrect ISM[​](#relayer-selecting-incorrect-ism "Direct link to Relayer Selecting Incorrect ISM")

Ensure the Interchain Security Module (ISM) on your chain is configured correctly. An incorrect ISM can result in messages not being processed. Verify the ISM address in your configuration and ensure it matches your deployment setup.

## Advanced Troubleshooting[​](#advanced-troubleshooting "Direct link to Advanced Troubleshooting")

### `eth_getStorageAt()` Compatibility[​](#eth_getstorageat-compatibility "Direct link to eth_getstorageat-compatibility")

Some chains do not natively support the [`eth_getStorageAt()`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_getstorageat) API. If you're deploying on one of these chains and encounter issues, review the changes made to the Hyperlane codebase in this [commit](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/commit/871df7a4dce203ff5cf23ae654d03743dc00ea61).

To deploy Hyperlane on these chains follow the steps:

1. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo)
2. Apply the changes in the [commit](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/commit/871df7a4dce203ff5cf23ae654d03743dc00ea61).
3. Build the project from the root directory: `yarn build`
4. Run the Hyperlane CLI from the root directory: `yarn workspace @hyperlane-xyz/cli hyperlane`
