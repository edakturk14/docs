## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

The Hyperlane CLI is the official command-line tool for deploying Hyperlane contracts to new chains. It also includes utilities for interacting with deployed contracts and registries.

The published version is available [on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperlane-xyz/cli). The source is available [on GitHub in the monorepo](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/tree/main/typescript/cli).

## Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup")

```

Alternatively, for running individual commands, you can use `npx` or `dlx`:

## Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage")

To view a list of the available commands and their arguments, run `hyperlane --help`.

A few common command options include:

* `--version`: Display your current installed version of the CLI
* `--registry`: Set the registry URI to use for chain metadata and contract addresses
* `--overrides`: Set an additional path for overrides to the canonical registry data
* `log`: Set the log format for the CLI (defaults to pretty)
* `verbosity`: Set the log level for the CLI (defaults to info)
* `key`: Set the key to use for signing transactions (defaults to the HYP\_KEY env var)

## Registries[​](#registries "Direct link to Registries")

By default, the CLI will pull chain metadata and contract addresses from the [canonical Hyperlane Registry](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry) but will write new configs and deployments to your local filesystem. For more information see the [Registries page](/docs/reference/registries).
