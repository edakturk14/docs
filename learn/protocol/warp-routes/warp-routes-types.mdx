| **Warp Route Type**          | **Description**                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Native Token Warp Routes     | Enables direct transfers of native gas tokens (e.g., ETH) across chains without wrapping.        |
| Collateral-Backed ERC20      | Locks ERC20 tokens as collateral on the source chain for cross-chain transfers.                  |
| Synthetic ERC20              | Mints new ERC20 tokens on the destination chain to represent the original tokens.                |
| Multi-Collateral Warp Routes | Allows liquidity to be sourced from multiple collateral tokens.                                  |
| Specialized Warp Routes      | Adds advanced features or integrates with specific use cases (e.g., vaults, fiat-backed tokens.) |

## Core Warp Route Types[​](#core-warp-route-types "Direct link to Core Warp Route Types")

### Native Token Warp Routes[​](#native-token-warp-routes "Direct link to Native Token Warp Routes")

Implemented in `HypNative.sol`, native warp routes handle the transfer of native gas tokens (e.g. ETH on Ethereum or Arbitrum, MNT on Mantle) across different chains.

#### Features[​](#features "Direct link to Features")

* Directly transfers native tokens without wrapping.
* Uses `msg.value` for transfer amount.
* Handles excess `msg.value` as hook payment.
* Supports donations through a `receive()` function.

See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/HypNative.sol) for more details.

### Collateral-Backed ERC20 Warp Routes[​](#collateral-backed-erc20-warp-routes "Direct link to Collateral-Backed ERC20 Warp Routes")

Implemented in `HypERC20Collateral.sol`, collateral warp routes enable ERC20 tokens to be locked as collateral on the source chain and then used to mint a synthetic representation on the destination chain.

#### Features[​](#features-1 "Direct link to Features")

* Wraps existing ERC20 tokens as collateral for transfers.
* Locks tokens in the contract on the source chain.
* Releases equivalent tokens on the destination chain.
* Uses SafeERC20 for secure token transfers.

See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/HypERC20Collateral.sol) for more details.

### Synthetic ERC20 Warp Routes[​](#synthetic-erc20-warp-routes "Direct link to Synthetic ERC20 Warp Routes")

Implemented in `HypERC20.sol`, synthetic warp routes mint new tokens on the destination chain that represent the original tokens from the source chain. The original tokens are not transferred but remain locked.

#### Features[​](#features-2 "Direct link to Features")

* Maintains consistent total supply across all chains.
* Supports custom token attributes (name, symbol, decimals).
* Mints new tokens on the destination chain.
* Burns tokens on the source chain when transferred back.

See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/HypERC20.sol) for more details.

## Advanced Features[​](#advanced-features "Direct link to Advanced Features")

### TokenRouter Functionality[​](#tokenrouter-functionality "Direct link to TokenRouter Functionality")

All warp routes extend the `TokenRouter` contract, which provides the core functionality for warp route token transfers.

#### Features[​](#features-3 "Direct link to Features")

1. **Message Structure**: Uses [TokenMessage](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/libs/TokenMessage.sol) library for encoding and decoding token transfer messages.

2. **Transfer Initiation**: `transferRemote` function initiates cross-chain transfers.

3. **Message Handling**: `_handle` function processes incoming transfer messages.

4. **Abstract Methods**:

   * `_transferFromSender`: Implemented by all warp routes to handle token collection.
   * `_transferTo`: Implemented by all warp routes to handle token distribution.

#### TokenMessage Format[​](#tokenmessage-format "Direct link to TokenMessage Format")

```
[32 bytes for recipient][32 bytes for amount][remaining bytes for metadata]
```

This standardized format ensures consistent handling across different warp route implementations while allowing for extensibility through metadata.

See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/libs/TokenRouter.sol) for more details.

### FastTokenRouter Transfers[​](#fasttokenrouter-transfers "Direct link to FastTokenRouter Transfers")

Implemented in `FastTokenRouter.sol`, this router extends TokenRouter and provides faster token transfers through a liquidity provider mechanism.

#### Features[​](#features-4 "Direct link to Features")

* Allows liquidity providers to fulfill transfer requests before message processing.
* Includes a `fastFee` to incentivize liquidity providers.
* Introduces `fastTransferId` for unique transfer identification.

See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/libs/FastTokenRouter.sol) for more details.

## Specialized Warp Route Extensions[​](#specialized-warp-route-extensions "Direct link to Specialized Warp Route Extensions")

### 1. Fast Collateral Transfers (FastHypERC20Collateral)[​](#1-fast-collateral-transfers-fasthyperc20collateral "Direct link to 1. Fast Collateral Transfers (FastHypERC20Collateral)")

* See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/extensions/FastHypERC20Collateral.sol) for more details.

### 2. Vault Integration (HypERC4626OwnerCollateral, HypERC4626Collateral)[​](#2-vault-integration-hyperc4626ownercollateral-hyperc4626collateral "Direct link to 2. Vault Integration (HypERC4626OwnerCollateral, HypERC4626Collateral)")

* Allows for yield generation on collateral by integrating with ERC-4626 vaults.
* See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/extensions/HypERC4626OwnerCollateral.sol) & [rebasing variant](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/extensions/HypERC4626Collateral.sol) and for more details.

### 3. Fiat-Backed Tokens (HypFiatToken)[​](#3-fiat-backed-tokens-hypfiattoken "Direct link to 3. Fiat-Backed Tokens (HypFiatToken)")

* Designed for stablecoins and other fiat-backed tokens, implementing specific mint and burn operations.
* See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/extensions/HypFiatToken.sol) for more details.

### 4. Scaled Native Tokens (HypNativeScaled)[​](#4-scaled-native-tokens-hypnativescaled "Direct link to 4. Scaled Native Tokens (HypNativeScaled)")

* Scales native token values for consistency across chains with different decimals.
* See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/extensions/HypNativeScaled.sol) for more details.

* Enables cross-chain transfers of xERC20 tokens, integrating with lockbox mechanisms for conversions.
* See the [HypXERC20 implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/extensions/HypXERC20.sol) and the [HypXERC20Lockbox implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/extensions/HypXERC20Lockbox.sol) for more details.
