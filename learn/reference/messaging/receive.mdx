title: "Receive a message"
description: "How to handle and verify incoming interchain messages with Hyperlane's Mailbox contract"
---

To deliver interchain messages, the [relayer](/docs/operate/relayer/run-relayer.mdx) calls `Mailbox.process()`.

This function takes as parameters the message to deliver, as well as arbitrary metadata that can be specified by the relayer.

The `Mailbox` will pass the message and metadata to the recipient's Interchain Security Module (ISM) for verification. If the ISM successfully verifies the message, the `Mailbox` delivers the message to the recipient by calling `recipient.handle()`.

  [`Message.sol`](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/libs/Message.sol)

## Handle

This function is called by the `Mailbox` contract when a message is received.

<Warning>
  To ensure only valid interchain messages are accepted, it is important to
  restrict [access control](#access-control) to the Mailbox address.
</Warning>

### Solidity

```solidity
function handle(
    uint32 _origin,
    bytes32 _sender,
    bytes calldata _messageBody
) external;
```

**Parameters**

- `origin`: Domain of origin chain
- `sender`: Address of sender on origin chain as bytes32
- `messageBody`: Raw bytes content of message body

<Info>
Sender addresses are left-padded to `bytes32` for compatibility with virtual machines that are addressed differently. The following utility is provided in the [`TypeCasts` library](../libraries/typecasts.mdx) for convenience.

```solidity
function bytes32ToAddress(bytes32 _bytes32) internal pure returns (address) {
    return address(uint160(uint256(_bytes32)));
}
```

</Info>

### Access Control

The `handle` function should be restricted to the Mailbox address if the contract should only accept calls from interchain messages.

The following utility is provided in the [`MailboxClient` library](../libraries/mailboxclient.mdx) for convenience.

```solidity
modifier onlyMailbox() {
    require(
        msg.sender == address(mailbox),
        "MailboxClient: sender not mailbox"
    );
    _;
}
```

### Examples

```solidity
function handle(
    uint32 _origin,
    bytes32 _sender,
    bytes calldata _messageBody
) external override onlyMailbox {
    lastSender = _sender;
    lastData = _messageBody;
    emit ReceivedMessage(_origin, _sender, _messageBody);
}
```

## Verify

When a message is received, the Mailbox will verify security with an [Interchain Security Module](../ISM/specify-your-ISM.mdx) before calling the message recipient's `handle`.

### Default Security

To query the default ISM address, you can call the `defaultIsm` function.

### Modular Security

To leverage Hyperlane's modular security, message recipients can specify a custom Interchain Security Module to **verify anything** about incoming messages. The Mailbox will defer to this ISM when specified.
